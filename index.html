		<h1>IceMan & FireBall</h1>
		<p>
	A Long Time Ago In A Galaxy Not That Far Away, there was a man from a 	planet named Iceatron and a woman from Firarmy the two planets were at war 	and had been for many years but this man helped the woman. His name was 	Iceman. He helped her until all of her injuries were cured and they came 	to love each other so much that they had two children they named one ice 	man jr and the other Fireball one was fire and one was ice and because of 	the war iceman jr was sent to iceatron and fireball was sent to firarmy 	soon after iceman and the woman died for treason but the children 	survived. Fast forward 18 years to the present. An Iceatronian boy named 	Ice Man was fighting for the war to end in his ship. He had three firarmy 	attackers on his tail and he had to think fast. He shot one down but the 	other ones kept coming. Thinking fast he sent a torpedo at one but the 	other shot him down. He used the escape pod and crash-landed in firarmy, 	enemy territory. With the remaining power, he cloaked himself as a human 	and went to the nearest repair shop. There a man named Fireball helped him 	fix his ship, they went to test it and just then, iceman’s cloak 	malfunctioned and caused nearby authorities to chase the ship offplanet 	with fireball on it. The two found a nearby asteroid to land on out of 	sight. Now Fireball was a fugitive for aiding an enemy and Iceman is 	fighting in the war. They argued and decided that they would have trouble 	clearing Fireball's name and they were in similar situations so they 	should team up. Iceman told Fireball about his hope for peace and they 	shared the fact that their parents were both dead. And that they only had 	one picture of them. They showed each other and to their surprise, the 	pictures were the same. Which means they were brothers. They came up with 	a plan that if they got the two planets to have a common enemy they could 	get them to work together so they started to steal treasures. Gold, 	jewels, artifacts, anything worth something and because they had fire and 	ice working together, they couldn’t be stopped! After years of doing this, 	Iceman had a new ship even though he didn’t need oxygen to survive, they 	started planning missions on the way to the planets and they found one 	particular artifact that was in legends. The interdimensional transporter. 	It opens a portal to any dimension. Thousands of years ago there was 	regular travel between dimensions but that has long since been forgotten. 	Iceman and Fireball fought and thought their way through to the artifact 	and just as they got ahold of it, the Iceatronians and firarmy came so 	Iceman and Fireball quickly used the artifact to escape. Only one 	dimension’s frequency was open and it was 237 later deemed the king 	dimension where Fireball’s king counterpart was named Flame King and 	Iceman’s was Ice King. The reason that frequency was open was because 	flame king had come upon the device and was studying it to see how it 	worked flame king and ice king were brothers like Iceman and Fireball but 	ice king found immense power and went rogue he now leads a kingdom of 	servants and if anyone betrays him the punishment is death. Flame King is 	the only one who can be anywhere near icekings power but even he cannot 	defeat him. The three devise a plan to imprison Ice King, to take his 	powers and his pet panda. As they get ready, they set up the power 	dampeners and a simple trap to catch the panda but unbeknownst to them 	iceking saw this coming and brought a device of his own creation to 	reverse the effects and send them into a simulation. Iceking shot the beam 	at Iceman first but because he was made of ice it went through and bounced 	off him at the same time so all four of them got trapped and they were 	reborn with no memories. After 20 years they escaped and with no 	recollection of the past events in the real world except that iceking must 	be stopped so they fought Ice King and won. They spent the next months 	retrieving their memories and going back to their own dimensions. Iceman 	and Fireball served their time in prison and with a new peace among the 	planets iceman and Fireball started saving people's lives occasionally 	checking to see if ice king had escaped iceman learned a few new tricks 	with his powers for example, with the help of fireball he could melt and 	become waterboy or he could freeze himself and become a massive snow golem 	with its own gravitational field. Fireball could do the same, with the 	help of Iceman he could become obsidian man or he could heat himself up 	and become supernova and could shoot beams of pure energy, just looking at 	him could burn you. But the next time iceman went to check on iceking all 	he found was a water leak in the room below his cell.
